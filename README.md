# tic-tac-toe
Basic tic-tac-toe game.

Notes:

game.js
- Marks a cell adding a class for X or O. 
- Once a cell has a class, clicks are ignored.
- A data structure (matrix) can be easily added if needed.

style.js
- It's using a basic media query just to decide the size of grid of the game.
- It's using Viewport Height or Viewport Width depending on the orientation.


Note: this was coded using ES6 without webpack. Will work only in certain browsers such as the latest version of Safari and Chrome.
